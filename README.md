#### Facultad de Ingenieria, UdelaR. 2024

This repository contains the individual work done in the course. There's one workshop ("taller" in spanish) per week, contained in each `tN` folder (the `t` stands for "taller").

## Workshop summaries

1. Titanic survivor binary classifier, based on features of every passenger. Concluded that the most significant features are the passenger's class and sex (as women were prioritized in the lifeboats).
2. IMDB movie reviews sentiment binary classifier. Final result of 87% accuracy in test set, using stop words, bigrams and tf-idf metric for weighting.
